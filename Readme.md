# 🤖 ML/NLP Engineer Intern Challenge

## 🎯 Objective
Build a complete text classification pipeline using Hugging Face Transformers. Demonstrate your skills in NLP preprocessing, model fine-tuning, and evaluation.

---

## 📋 Task Overview
- Select a small labeled text dataset (e.g., movie reviews, sentiment analysis, classification of text)
- Preprocess and tokenize using Hugging Face Transformers
- Fine-tune a pre-trained model (DistilBERT recommended)
- Evaluate using F1, Precision, and Recall metrics
- Document insights and improvement ideas
- **Bonus**: Extend to multilingual use case
